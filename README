NFC Batch Writer

The NFC Batch Writer is a tool which allows users to encode a batch of NFC Tags from a single file
containing all the records to be written. It reads the data contained in the file to generate the
NDEF messages to be encoded and wait for the user to put the tag to be encoded on the reader device.

This tool is at the moment specific to ACR122 USB NFC desktop reader devices and will only encode
Mifare Ultralight/C (Type 2) NFC tags, however the code should be adaptable to other devices and tags.

The program uses some functions provided in the NFC-Tools libraries, which can be found here on GitHub :
https://github.com/grundid/nfctools

In order to run the tool, you will need the pcscd library installes on the computer.


The file format used for the input file is a CSV file using semilocon as separator. The very first line shall
only contain a boolean indicating whether the encoded tags should be made Read-Only. The following lines
correspond to the different entries to be written on the tags, with one line per tag.
A line shall be composed of one or more records separated by semilocons, and each record shall include the
record type and its parameters separated by semilocons.

The different types available are text, uri, aar (Android Application Record), bookmark, sms, mail, tel, geo.
For each of those types, the parameters to be input are :
text : Text
uri : Uri
aar : Package
bookmark : Title; Uri
sms : Title; Number; Message
mail : Title; Adress; Subject; Message
tel : Title; Number
geo : Title; Coordinate 1; Coordinate 2

An exemple Bookmark record would be bookmark;Google;http://www.google.fr.
Several records can be put on the same tag up to the data capacity of the tag. For example, the entry
text;Text1;text;Text2;text;Text3 will encode three text records in the NFC tag.
Some other examples can be found in the example.csv file provided with the project.
